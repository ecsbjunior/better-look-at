# 🔍 Better Look At — See More
**Better Look At** is a Hytale mod that provides a clean, informative, and real-time HUD when you look at blocks, or entities in the world. Instead of guessing, you get clear and contextual information exactly where and when you need it. Inspired by classic information HUD mods, Better Look At is designed to be **lightweight**, **configurable**, and **easy to expand**, making it useful for both casual players and more technical users.
